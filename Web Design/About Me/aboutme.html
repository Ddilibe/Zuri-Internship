					<h1 style="text-align: center;">Dilibe Fidelugwuowo</h1>
					<p> My name is Dilibe. I have been coding for about two years. I have seen and experienced a lot. I have cemented my decision to start a career in the tech industry. I like the idea that we control what goes on in our lives, the most part of it though. One of the things I would like to acheive during my time on earth is to be a force to be reckoned with in my major areas of specialization</p>
					<ul> I do have a lot of hobbies and interests to take my occupy when I am not buried deep in a book or coding.
						<li> I love listening to music while looking into the abyss</li>
						<li> I like to watch anime during my down days </li>
						<li> I like surfing the web looking out for somethings that catches my interest</li>
						<li> I also like browsing through pictures for stuff like wallpaper and designing</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Yea, you are probably thinking "He is a boring boy, I wonder what his life is like". Well, I think that you are right. The problem is I ain't bordered. It is probably time to know what I priotize </p>
					<br>
					<ol>I priotizes a lot of things but these are my top four. I guess you can call it "The Four Doors to success" or whatever. Here It goes
						<li>I like to keep my environment clean at all time; at least, I try</li>
						<li>I like to read a lot but not school books or novels; just books i generate interest for </li>
						<li>I love coding a lot. Coding gives me a power to create a world which I can bend the rules to my liking. Yes, you can call it playing God</li>
						<li>I priotize praying. Praying is one of the only way that I can voice out my feelings for anything at all</li>
					</ol>
					<p>That's all about me you need to know for now. These are my skills: HTML5, CSS, Python, Django, Django Rest, React, Javascript, C, Git, Linux and Flask</p>
